# What is Puhti?

Puhti is an e-commerce service where you can take a bloodtest and get results based on what kind of package you chose.
At the time of writing there are around 86 different tests you can test on your blood.

# The stack

Puhti uses WordPress for the website backend so the e-commerce shop was handcrafted with _you guessed it_ WooCommerce. WooCommerce documentation has has be one of the most confusing I've ever encountered, so the process to make up with the project customer's requests it took quit the time to find the correct methods to use and deciding which plugins to install. 

For the Dashboard which the user logs into was made in collaboration with KiskoLabs.

# What did I do?

This was one of the first times I've used WooCommerce, so logically I jumped directly to managing the WooCommerce data-flow, learning how to manage the shopping cart, handling custom product templates and learning about WordPress REST API.
