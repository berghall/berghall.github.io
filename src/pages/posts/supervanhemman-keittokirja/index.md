# What is Supervanhemman keittokirja?

Supervanhemman keittokirja is THE __mobile-first__ recipe tool for the busy family parents, but do not fear, it has also got recipes for holidays and other themes.
The app includes some of Finland's most popular bloggers along with their favorite recipes.

# Our stack

For our PWA ([Progressive Web App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications)) we used ReactJS for the front-end along with the Foundation CSS framework. For state management we used Redux which goes along well with ReactJS.

To fetch the recipes we decided to use the WordPress REST API. This made it easy for content creators to add recipes to the site.

# What I did and learned

This was one of the first React bundled with Redux projects I ever did. At first the learning curve with Redux seemed very harsh and I didn't know what to make of it. But the more I read up on tutorials and watched YouTube videos on the topic the more I learned about Reduxs' pros and cons.

The React part was more familiar with me from before, so many of my tasks were to implement front-end changes from the wireframes/layout we had planned with the customer.
